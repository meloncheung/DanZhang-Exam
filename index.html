      <h1><em>How will coronavirus impact the world economy? </em></h1>
      <p class="lead">Coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, is still knocking the world now. It swept China first since January, then the West by  the end of February and later Latin America. On 26th May, when the work was being submitted, over 5 million people were  infected globally, and 350 thousand died. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">Beyond health concerns, the pandemic also has a significant impact on the global economy. Previous studies of epidemics such as H1N1 points out an epidemic would affect the economy negatively. Fear of infection and containment measures implimented to stop the transmission will disrupt regular economic activity and decreased trades.

	<p>If we have a closer look at top-ten countries affected by a coronavirus, it shows the situation in the U.S. is far more complicated than other top-ten countries. In contrast, European countries such as France, Spain and the U.K. have a higher fatality rate at above 14%.</p>
    
    <p>How about China? China is the first country affected  by the pandemic. The map above shows China has 84,000 cases, far less than top-ten affected countries.<p>

	  <br>
	  <p align="justify" >Since 2010, English local authorities have been seriously hit by austerity. If Theresa May said at the end of 2018 that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-45733098/theresa-may-people-need-to-know-austerity-is-over">austerity had come to an end</a>, it will take time to recover.
	  According to the Institute for fiscal studies, local governments' budget is on average now  <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/local-authorities-budgets/">26% lower than before austerity policies began. </a> </p>
	  <p align="justify">Since 2018, <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local"> Bureau Local </a> has started to investigate on the repercussions of austerity on the local authorities' budgets and activity. 
	  <p align="justify"> Cuts in social services, education or culture, problems to balance the budget, selling assets to finance redundancies: the Bureau Local network has found out that local authorities are financially under pressure. </p>

	<p> How did each local council or region get affected? As Bureau Local<a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local/open-resources"> publishes all their data</a>, this project has the objective to expand on their work and to try to break down their national dataset into different local perspectives. </p>
