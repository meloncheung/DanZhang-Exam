      <h1><em>How will coronavirus impact the world economy? </em></h1>
      <p class="lead">Coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, is still knocking the world now. It swept China first since January, then the West by the end of February and later Latin America. On 26th May, over 5 million people were infected globally with 350,000 fatalities due to the virus. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">Beyond health concerns, the pandemic also has a significant impact on the global economy. Previous studies of epidemics such as H1N1 points out an epidemic would affect the economy negatively. Fear of infection and containment measures implimented to stop the transmission will disrupt regular economic activity and decreased trades.  
</p>
      <p class="lead">Before heading into economic fallout, let us have a look at the current situation of coronavirus.

	<p>If we have a closer look at top-ten countries affected by a coronavirus, it shows the situation in the U.S. is far more complicated than other top-ten countries. In contrast, European countries such as France, Spain and the U.K. have a higher fatality rate at above 14%.</p>
    
    <p>How about China? China is the first country affected  by the pandemic. The map above shows China has 84,000 cases, far less than top-ten affected countries.<p>

By mid of March, China tamped down coronavirus with less than 100 new cases per day. In May, daily new cases are under 10. It seems coronavirus only hit China in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

        <p align="justify"> The picture beside shows the performance of top-ten countries in terms of GDP in 2020, according to IMF projection. It shows that all the top-ten countries will see GDP contraction, ranging from -2%  in India to -9.4% in Italy. The GDP of China and India are still projected to grow in 2020. Yet these figures of 1.2% and 1.9% respectively are much lower than before.</p>
        
<p>Other countries, especially the advanced economy group such as the U.S. and European Union, however, will be affected by the pandemic dramatically.

In the financial crisis in 2008, India and Chinaâ€™s economy still saw increases in their GDP growth, although other countries saw declines. Also, if we compared the gap between 2008 to 2009 with the last picture, we can find the drop of economic growth will be larger this time.</p>

        <p align="justify"> The time of the outbreak of coronavirus in these three countries partly explained their trends, since massive outbreaks began at the end of March. However, as the economic outlook by IMF was released in April, it means the IMF may still underestimate the economic fallout by a coronavirus in the world economy.</p>
