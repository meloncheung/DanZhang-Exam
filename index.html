      <h1><em>How will coronavirus impact the world economy? </em></h1>
      <p class="lead">Coronavirus (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, is still knocking the world now. It swept China first since January, then the West by  the end of February and later Latin America. On 26th May, when the work was being submitted, over 5 million people were  infected globally, and 350 thousand died. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">Beyond health concerns, the pandemic also has a significant impact on the global economy. Previous studies of epidemics such as H1N1 points out an epidemic would affect the economy negatively. Fear of infection and containment measures implimented to stop the transmission will disrupt regular economic activity and decreased trades.  
</p>
      <p class="lead">Before heading into economic fallout, let us have a look at the current situation of coronavirus.

	<p>If we have a closer look at top-ten countries affected by a coronavirus, it shows the situation in the U.S. is far more complicated than other top-ten countries. In contrast, European countries such as France, Spain and the U.K. have a higher fatality rate at above 14%.</p>
    
    <p>How about China? China is the first country affected  by the pandemic. The map above shows China has 84,000 cases, far less than top-ten affected countries.<p>

        <p align="justify"> The chart beside explains why China has a relatively smaller infected population. It shows China was hit by the coronavirus, mainly in February. By mid of March, China tamped down coronavirus with less than 100 new cases per day. In May, daily new cases are under 10. It seems coronavirus only hit China in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
